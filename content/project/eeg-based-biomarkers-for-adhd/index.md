Ever since I began to work on electrophysiology and cognitive research, it has been my foremost conviction that tools like machine learning and deep learning would enable a new paradigm for biomarker discovery in psychiatry and neurology.

During my PhD, I worked on different deep learning architectures to diagnose Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients from healthy controls and to predict which patients with REM Behavior Disorder (RBD) would eventually develop Parkinson's disease up to 6 years before they develop any symptoms.
