During my time at Starlab, I worked in [AsTeRICS](https://project.asterics.eu/) project (Assistive Technology Rapid Integration & Construction Set), where our goal was to develop a construction set for assistive technologies which can be adapted to the motor abilities of end-users. AsTeRICS is intended to allow access to different devices such as PCs, cell phones and smart home devices, with all of them integrated in a platform adapted as much as possible to each user.

Possible applications include:

* Computer input (mouse, keyboard, joystick)
* Environmental Control (KNX, FS20, IR)
* Toys and Games (Playstation 3, computer games …)
* Brain/Neural computer interfaces (Enobio, OpenVIBE, OpenEEG)
* Android Phone support (SMS, calls)
