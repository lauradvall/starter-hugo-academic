Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that uses weak electric currents delivered via electrodes to the head, changing transmembrane potential of the neurons and thus increasing or decreasing the probability of the neurons to fire in the desired areas. tDCS is currently being investigated as a treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder.

The use of tDCS to study anatomical and physiological dynamics and circuits supporting cognition and executive functions in particular has dramatically increased in recent years. However, its mechanisms of action remain only partially understood.

During my PhD, I assessed the cognitive and physiological effects of anodal tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on executive function in order to understand (1) the role of DLPFC laterality, (2) the physiological dynamics sustaining the modulation of executive function by tDCS, and (3) the impact of state-dependent dynamics, both in healthy controls and patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
