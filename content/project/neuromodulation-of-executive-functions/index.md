Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that uses weak electric currents delivered via electrodes to the head, changing transmembrane potential of the neurons and thus increasing or decreasing the probability of the neurons to fire in the desired areas. tDCS is currently being investigated as a treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder, neuropathic pain, epilepsy or ADHD, among many others.

During the last 10 years I have been involved in several projects using tDCS to study anatomical and physiological brain dynamics and circuits supporting cognition and executive functions, as well as its potential as a treatment for epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric conditions.
