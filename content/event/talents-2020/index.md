title: Talents 2020
abstract: >-
  I am especially concerned with the small number of women involved in STEM
  fields, both at academia and industry. Stereotypes place women at
  non-technical roles in society, and the scarcity of current female
  professionals in technology and scientific careers that could encourage young
  women to develop a career in IT also creates a Catch-22 situation. For this
  reason, it is especially important that women professionals explain their work
  to high schools students with the goal of encouraging and normalizing the
  presence of women in STEM. With this goal, I've participated in different
  events aimed at disseminating women's work in technical fields.


  The video below is an example of a talk I gave in the framework of "Talents 2020", a program organized by the association "Arrenca a c√≥rrer", in which different entrepreneurs are invited to share their stories, dreams and passions with a group of high school students to promote the core values of entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity among boys and girls.
