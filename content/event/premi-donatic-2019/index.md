title: Premi DonaTIC 2019
abstract: >-
  I am especially concerned with the small number of women involved in STEM
  fields, both at academia and industry. Stereotypes place women at
  non-technical roles in society, and the scarcity of current female
  professionals in technology and scientific careers that could encourage young
  women to develop a career in IT also creates a Catch-22 situation. For this
  reason, it is especially important that women professionals explain their work
  to secondary schools and talk about their experiences.


  In this line, in 2019 I received the “Dona TIC” award by the Catalan government to women in STEM fields. The goal of this award is to recognize and promote the fundamental role of women in the professional, business and academic world of new technologies, and to provide new female role models to young women in order to encourage them to develop their careers in STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).


  I was recently interviewed regarding this award at FibraCat TV, a national Catalan TV channel promoting the role of women in technology:
