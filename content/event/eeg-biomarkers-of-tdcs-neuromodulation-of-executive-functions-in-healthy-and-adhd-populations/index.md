title: EEG biomarkers of tDCS neuromodulation of executive functions in healthy
  and ADHD populations
abstract: >-
  Numerical head models in transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) have become
  a powerful and robust tool for planning stimulation. Due to the development of
  computational algorithms to segment MRIs, it is now possible to create on a
  personalized way realistic volume conductor head models. These head models can
  be used to analyze commonly used montages, in a retrospective manner and to
  determine the characteristics of the electric field distribution in the head.
  They can also be combined with montage optimization algorithms that allow for
  the determination of the dose parameters (electrode positions and currents)
  that optimally stimulate specific target areas in the subjectâ€™s brain.
  Moreover, the next generation of models should combine passive physical
  properties with more sophisticated representations of the physiological
  effects of tES, providing a link with measures obtained from fMRI/EEG,
  enabling the creation of a more sophisticated personalization of the
  optimization protocols.

  In this symposium we will discuss new developments that allow for a faster creation of personalized head models and how to leverage these head models to plan experiments in tES. We will also present a new physiological modeling approach for tES and electrophysiological biomarkers of neuromodulation in ADHD.
