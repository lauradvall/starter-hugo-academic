I enjoy spending time with my family, especially my son. As a family we travel often to new places, and it was in one of these trips that I discovered photography as one of my passions. I love photography and all it has to do with it; traveling, meeting new people, getting into the most remote places just to see another perspective of the world. If you share the same passion, I invite you to check out my [portfolio](<https://500px.com/lauradv>) and [drop me a line](https://lauradubreuilvall.netlify.app/#contact) if you want to chat about it.[](https://500px.com/lauradv)
