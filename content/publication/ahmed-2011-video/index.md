abstract: In this paper, we present the development of an in-air acoustic
  test-bed for rapid proof-of-concept testing of (underwater) communication
  technologies. In addition to more accurately representing the actual channel
  when compared to simulation, the test-bed also provides an easy method to
  introduce channel impairments, such as Doppler distortion, in a controlled
  manner. This can be advantageous when the experiments need to be reproduced at
  a later time. We present the testing of video transmission over an acoustic
  channel using this test-bed. We utilize MPEG-4 video compression as it has
  efficient low bit rate compression capabilities. OFDM is chosen as the
  modulation technique as it provides robust high speed acoustic communication
  over underwater channels which are characterized by frequency selectivity and
  Doppler distortion.
