abstract: Existing strategies to enhance motor function following Spinal Cord
  Injury (SCI) are suboptimal leaving patients with considerable disability.
  Available evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation
  (tDCS) is a promising method to improve motor dysfunction. How tDCS affects
  resting brain activity monitored by EEG is little explored.
