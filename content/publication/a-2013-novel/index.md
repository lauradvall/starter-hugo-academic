abstract: Neurofeedback (NF) is a type of biofeedback that uses real time
  display of electroencephalography to illustrate brain activity. EEG features
  are extracted and displayed allowing the user to, with practice, modulate
  their temporal evolution. Neurofeedback training has many therapeutic
  applications such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
  migraine, depression or conduct disorders. This document presents NeuroSurfer,
  a novel general-purpose tool for neurofeedback training with a use case of
  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment.
