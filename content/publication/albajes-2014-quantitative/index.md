abstract: 'This chapter is part of the book "EEG/ERP Analysis: Methods and
  Applications" and it attempts to give different examples of applications of
  quantitative EEG (qEEG) for the realization of brain-computer interfaces
  (BCIs). In particular, we think that neurotechnologies for BCIs based on
  electroencephalography (EEG) offer advanced tools of interest for other
  research and application fields. EEG-BCI technologies are based on the
  electrical nature of brain activity. EEG-BCI captures the user state or intent
  via electrical signals recorded on the scalp and maps them into computer or
  device commands. As the reader can imagine, such a process goes through an
  intermediate process of quantification. We explain some of these techniques in
  the following chapter.'
