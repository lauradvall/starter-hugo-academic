abstract: "Little is known about how the brain processes information while
  navigating without visual cues. Technical limitations recording brain activity
  during real-world navigation have impeded research in this field. We have
  developed a study paradigm that benefits from wireless EEG recording
  technology. Participants heard a sequence of directional commands instructing
  them to physically or mentally navigate a 3 Ã— 3 m grid. Data from a sighted
  control and an individual with profound blindness highlight the viability of
  the technology. A power spectral density analysis on the alpha frequency band
  during the physical navigation task revealed diffuse signal fluctuations for
  the blind participant, while a more robust signal within occipital-parietal
  regions was seen for the sighted control. Both participants displayed highly
  similar signal fluctuations during mental navigation. This work demonstrates
  the feasibility of brain activity recording during navigation-related tasks
  using a wireless EEG system for identifying brain processing patterns
  associated with visual experience.\t"
