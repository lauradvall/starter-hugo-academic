abstract: "This paper addresses the feasibility of underwater wireless video
  transmission using an acoustic system, which consists of a video
  compressor/decompressor and an OFDM modulator/demodulator. This work includes
  two main parts: the design of an algorithm aimed to compensate for the Doppler
  effect and the assessment of a set of error resilience tools offered by the
  MPEG-4 standard. The results of the simulations and in-air experiments
  demonstrate the performance improvement in terms of visual quality of the
  received video in cases with motion, as well as the system robustness against
  channel induced errors."
