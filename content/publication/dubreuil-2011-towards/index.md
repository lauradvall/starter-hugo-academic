abstract: "This project addresses the implementation of an acoustic OFDM
  (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) system for underwater video
  transmissions aimed to work over short distance links, with short delays and
  relatively high available bandwidth. This work includes research on four main
  approaches: 1. Research on video compression techniques. 2. Research on
  modulation and detection techniques. 3. Design of signal processing techniques
  aimed to compensate for the Doppler effect caused by motion. 4. Research on
  techniques to reduce the channel coding applied to the video data. Regarding
  (1), it is important to find a suitable video compression technique that
  substantially reduces the amount of video data to be transmitted in order to
  properly utilize the limited bit rate capacity of the underwater channel. The
  chosen compression technique has been the VLBV (Very Low Bitrate Video) coder
  offered by the MPEG-4 standard due to its efficient low bit rate compression
  capabilities, aimed to work with conventional rectangular image sequences with
  high coding efficiency, high error robustness, low latency and low complexity
  for real-time applications. Concerning (2), the OFDM modulation technique has
  been considered for its excellent capabilities applicable to high speed
  communication systems in wireless acoustic underwater channels, characterized
  by frequency selectivity. However, the motion-induced Doppler distortion makes
  it important to design an efficient algorithm (3) that deals with the
  synchronization problems and frequency shifts caused by the accentuated
  Doppler effect in underwater channels. With regard to (4), a set of error
  resilience tools offered by the MPEG-4 standard has been implemented at the
  video encoder. These tools enable robust video communication over noisy
  wireless channels by offering additional protection over error bursts and
  maintaining the visual quality of the decoded video. This allows the
  conventional channel coding applied to the video data to be reduced, thus
  increasing the available data rate of the system."
