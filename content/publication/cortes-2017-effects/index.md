abstract: Existing strategies to enhance motor function following Spinal Cord
  Injury (SCI) are suboptimal leaving patients with considerable disability.
  Available evidence suggests that transcranial direct current stimulation
  (tDCS) has emerged as a promising method to improve motor dysfunction in other
  neurological disorders. However, little is known about the specific brain
  changes that result in improved motor performance following tDCS. Studying
  electroencephalography (EEG) responses to tDCS, has not been well-explored,
  and may provide us with valuable insight regarding the effects of
  neuromodulation techniques for individuals with SCI.
