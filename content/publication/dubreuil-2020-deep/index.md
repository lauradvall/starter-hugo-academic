abstract: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous
  neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the pediatric and adult
  population worldwide. The diagnosis remains essentially clinical, based on
  history and exam, with no available biomarkers. In this paper, we describe a
  convolutional neural network (CNN) with a four-layer architecture combining
  filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG
  time-frequency decompositions (spectrograms) of electroencephalography data
  (EEG), particularly of event-related potentials (ERP) from ADHD patients (n =
  20) and healthy controls (n = 20) collected during the Flanker Task, with 2800
  samples for each group. We treat the data as in audio or image classification
  approaches, where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting
  invariances and compositional features in the data. The model reaches a
  classification accuracy of 88% Â± 1.12%, outperforming the Recurrent Neural
  Network and the Shallow Neural Network used for comparison, and with the key
  advantage, compared with other machine learning approaches, of avoiding the
  need for manual selection of EEG spectral or channel features. The
  event-related spectrograms also provide greater accuracy compared to resting
  state EEG spectrograms. Finally, through the use of feature visualization
  techniques such as DeepDream, we show that the main features exciting the CNN
  nodes are a decreased power in the alpha band and an increased power in the
  delta-theta band around 100 ms for ADHD patients compared to healthy controls,
  suggestive of attentional and inhibition deficits, which have been previously
  suggested as pathophyisiological signatures of ADHD. While confirmation with
  larger clinical samples is necessary, these results suggest that deep networks
  may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from
  relatively small datasets, highlighting the potential of this methodology to
  develop biomarkers of practical clinical utility.
