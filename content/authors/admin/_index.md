I am an engineer working at the intersection of technology and neuroscience, with a deep passion for investigating the intricacies of the human brain to contribute to a greater understanding and improvement of our mental health as a society.

I graduated in Telecommunications Engineering at Polytechnic [University of Catalonia](https://telecos.upc.edu/en) (UPC). After working in academia ([ICFO](https://www.icfo.eu/)) and completing my master thesis at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/), I joined [Starlab](http://www.starlab.es/) as a Research Engineer, working in applied neuroscience R&D with a focus on EEG signal processing and data analysis for Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (tDCS, tACS and tRNS). After two years, I joined [Neuroelectrics](http://www.neuroelectrics.com/) team (Starlab's spinoff company) and I moved to Boston as a Technical Manager to open the first international offices of the company. During the following years I combined my job at Neuroelectrics with my PhD in Neuroscience at [University of Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu), in collaboration with [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), where I explored the use of deep learning techniques applied to EEG data to study brain dynamics and physiological biomarkers, as well as the use of transcranial current stimulation as a neuromodulation technique to improve executive function in healthy and clinical populations.

I am currently the Neurotech Innovation Lead at the [Neuroscience Product Development](https://www.roche.com/research_and_development/what_we_are_working_on/neuroscience.htm) division of Genentech/Roche in San Francisco (CA), where my goal is to identify and develop new technologies at the intersection of engineering, AI and medicine, bringing neurotech into biotechnology and leading the transformation of traditional diagnostics and therapies for psychiatric and neurological disorders. I am currently working on  different projects using machine learning to develop EEG-based biomarkers to predict disease progression, improve patient stratification and predict treatment response.
