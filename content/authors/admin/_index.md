I am an engineer working at the intersection of technology and neuroscience, with a deep passion for understanding the intricacies of the human brain and how this can improve our welfare as a society.

I graduated in Telecommunications Engineering at Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). After completing my master thesis at MIT, I held several research-related roles both in academia and industry ([Starlab](http://www.starlab.es/)). During these years I pursued a PhD in Neuroscience at University of Barcelona in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, while combining it with my job as the Technical Manager at [Neuroelectrics](http://www.neuroelectrics.com/), a startup company designing medical devices for brain monitoring (EEG) and non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS/tACS/tRNS).

I am currently the Neurotech Innovation Lead at the [Neuroscience Product Development](https://www.roche.com/research_and_development/what_we_are_working_on/neuroscience.htm) division of Genentech/Roche in San Francisco (CA), where my goal is to identify and develop new technologies at the intersection of engineering, data/AI and medicine, bringing neurotech into biotechnology and leading the transformation of traditional diagnostics and therapies for psychiatric and neurological disorders. I am currently working on  different projects using machine learning to develop EEG-based biomarkers to predict disease progression, improve patient stratification and predict drug responses.
