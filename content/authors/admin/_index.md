I am an engineer working at the intersection of technology and neuroscience, with a deep passion for understanding the intricacies of the human brain and how this can improve our welfare as a society.

I graduated in Telecommunications Engineering at Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). After completing my master thesis at MIT, I held several research-related roles both in academia and industry ([Starlab](http://www.starlab.es/)). During these years I pursued a PhD in Neuroscience at University of Barcelona in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, while combining it with my job as the Technical Manager at [Neuroelectrics](http://www.neuroelectrics.com/), a startup company designing medical devices for brain monitoring (EEG) and non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS/tACS/tRNS).

I am currently the Neurotech Innovation Lead at the [Neuroscience Product Development](https://www.roche.com/research_and_development/what_we_are_working_on/neuroscience.htm) division of Genentech/Roche in San Francisco (CA), where I bring together the business and academic fields with the goal of bridging the gap between innovative research and successful realization of clinically and commercially viable products for neuroscience. My ultimate goal is to identify and develop new technologies at the intersection of engineering, data/AI and medicine, bringing neurotech into biotechnology and leading the transformation of traditional diagnostics and therapies for psychiatric and neurological disorders.
