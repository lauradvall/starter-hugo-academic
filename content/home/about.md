I am an engineer working at the intersection of technology and neuroscience, with a deep passion for understanding the intricacies of the human brain and how this can improve our health as a society.  I graduated in Telecommunications Engineering at Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). After completing my master thesis at MIT, I held several research-related roles both in academia and industry (Starlab). During these years I pursued a PhD in Neuroscience at University of Barcelona in collaboration with Harvard Medical School, while combining it with my job as the Technical Manager at Neuroelectrics, a startup company designing medical devices for brain monitoring (EEG) and non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS/tACS/tRNS).
